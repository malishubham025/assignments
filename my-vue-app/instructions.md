**Objective:**
Recreate the section of Wonderla's website(Shown in the screenshot and the video recording) using **ReactJS** and **Tailwind CSS**. The component should be **Exact Match of the This Component with proper styling and animations (visit [Wonderla's website](https://www.wonderla.com) to see the animations** while ensuring proper component structuring and maintainability.

### **Requirements:**
1. **Framework & Styling:**
   - Use **ReactJS or NEXTJS**for the frontend.
   - Use **Tailwind CSS** for styling.

2. **Component Structure:**
   - **Main Component:** `RidesSection.jsx` (or similar) 
   - **Sub-components:**
     - `RideCard.jsx` for individual ride items.
     - `CategorySidebar.jsx` for ride categories (Land, Water, Kids).
     - `CarouselControls.jsx` for navigation arrows.

3. **Functionality:**
   - Implement **carousel functionality** to slide through rides.
   - Categories (Land, Water, Kids) should be clickable(but may lead to an empty page on clicking).
   - Ensure a **"Explore All Rides!"** button at the bottom.

4. **Data Handling:**
   - Use a **JSON file or a state object** to store ride details (image, title, description,etc. These image links and other stuff can be copied by going to wonderla's website and using inspect elements in developer's Mode).
   - Load ride data dynamically from a local json array instead of harcoding.

5. **Responsive Design:**
   - Mobile Responsiveness is **not needed**.
   - Ensure smooth transition effects for **hover, focus, and active states**.
